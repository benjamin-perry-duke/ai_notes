\chapter{Introduction to Machine Learning}

Machine learning is a rapidly growing field that focuses on developing algorithms and models that enable computers to learn and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. It has found applications in various domains, including computer vision, natural language processing, recommendation systems, and more.

In this chapter, we will explore the fundamental concepts of machine learning, including:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning
  \item Training and testing datasets
  \item Overfitting and underfitting
  \item Evaluation metrics for machine learning models
\end{itemize}

Machine learning relies heavily on mathematical concepts, particularly from linear algebra, calculus, and probability theory. Throughout this chapter, we will delve into the mathematical foundations that underpin machine learning algorithms and techniques.
